"""Post-update canary: did a game patch break CDUMM's readers?

Run this after every Crimson Desert update, before anyone reports a mod
doing nothing. It reads the installed game and answers one question per
table: *can CDUMM still decode what mods target?*

Why this exists
---------------
Almost every release in this project's history is reactive -- a patch moves
the bytes, mods silently stop applying, a user reports it days later, and
the layout gets re-derived under time pressure. The information needed to
catch it arrives the moment the patch lands; nothing was looking.

CI cannot look: it has no game install. So this is the thing a human runs
on a machine that has one, and its exit code is the number of problems so
it can gate a release.

Design rule: PRODUCTION ENTRY POINTS ONLY
-----------------------------------------
Every check drives the same call the apply path drives. That rule is not
decoration -- it is the single most expensive mistake in this codebase's
history, made at least four times:

  * #351/#352 drove ``parse_stock_list`` with a constant instead of
    ``locate_stock_list``, read the resulting garbage as a format
    regression, and cost two people a day before both retracted it.
  * measuring skill with ``parse_skill_entry`` instead of ``parse_all``
    skips ``_detect_is_no_alert`` entirely and reports 1424/2013 on a
    build that actually reads 2013/2013 (#355).
  * scoring a table with ``verified_order`` instead of ``select_order``
    skips variant selection and reports iteminfo at 10 fields of 113
    instead of 109.

An internal function fed something it is not meant to receive returns
plausible garbage, and plausible garbage looks exactly like drift.

What a failure here means
-------------------------
These readers refuse rather than write to a position they cannot account
for, so the failure mode is "mods report no changes", not "saves get
damaged". That is why this is worth catching early: the symptom is silent.
