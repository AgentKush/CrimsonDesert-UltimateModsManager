"""statusinfo.pabgb ``stat_level_data`` writer (DIRECT SPEED stat mods).

The always-active stat presets on Nexus (DIRECT MOVEMENT SPEED, DIRECT
ATTACK SPEED, ...) ship as ``.cdmod`` packages whose ``semantic.json`` sets
``stat_level_data[0..15]`` on ``statusinfo.pabgb``. ``cdmod_handler`` turns
each operation into a Format 3 intent::

    {key: 1000010, field: "stat_level_data[1]", op: "set", new: 58000000}

This writer applies those element writes byte-exact.

Layout
------
::

    record = <u32 key><u32 name_len><name : name_len bytes><tail>

Only the four "rate" stats -- MoveSpeedRate, AttackSpeedRate, CriticalRate
and DHIT -- carry a 212-byte tail. The other 71 stats have an 84-byte tail
with no ``stat_level_data`` at all. Inside a 212-byte tail::

    tail[  0 :  68]   68-byte header
    tail[ 68 : 196]   stat_level_data : 16 * uint64  (128 bytes)
    tail[196 : 204]   zero terminator slot
    tail[204 : 212]   8-byte constant, byte-identical on all four records

Values are fixed point with **24 fractional bits**: the integer a mod asks
for is stored as ``value << 24``. Vanilla decodes to round numbers under
that rule -- DHIT runs 0, 2000, 4000 ... 25000 and AttackSpeedRate runs
0, 29000000, 55000000 ... 250000000 -- and nothing else about the field is
inferred.

How the offset and the scale were established
---------------------------------------------
Not by reading the ramp. Mod 2511 publishes, for the same game version
(1.13.0), both the JSON V3 field mod and a PAZ overlay carrying the
already-modded table, so the request and its result ship side by side.

Searching every offset that partitions the 212-byte tail into whole
uint64s, and keeping only those that contain every byte the overlay
actually changed, leaves exactly two candidates: 68 and 76. At 68 all 144
written elements satisfy ``raw == asked << 24``; at 76 none of them do.
Feeding the mod's own intents through that rule reproduces the overlay
**byte for byte, with zero residual differences, on all six presets**
(2x/3x/4x AtkSpd, each alone and paired with 2xMovSpd).

This is the third offset tried. 80 shipped first and was wrong -- it ran
the array off the end into the constant at 204, which is why that trailer
looked like data. 76 was the natural correction and is also wrong: it
partitions the tail just as exactly, so no boundary argument separates the
two. Only the overlay does.

Guardrails (the project's never-corrupt bar)
--------------------------------------------
* A record whose tail is not 212 bytes is refused, never written -- a
  regular stat has no ``stat_level_data`` and writing into its tail would
  corrupt it.
* An index outside 0..15 is refused rather than reaching the terminator or
  the trailer.
* A value that does not fit the field once shifted is refused rather than
  silently wrapping.

Every refusal is returned to the caller and surfaced to the user; nothing
is dropped in silence. The writes are length-preserving, so the table and
its companion ``.pabgh`` offsets stay byte-identical everywhere the mod did
not touch.
