"""interactioninfo.pabgb interaction-range writer (Fast Pickup mods).

"Fast Pickup - Increase Range" (Nexus) sets
``interaction_pivot_list[0].raw_a`` and ``.raw_b`` on five interaction
records so gathering, skinning and insect-catching reach further. All
ten intents applied zero bytes: ``_interactionPivotList`` is field #26
of ``InteractionInfo`` with type ``None`` in the PABGB schema -- no
descriptor -- so the generic walker cannot reach it. ``parse_records``
returns 0 records for this table entirely.

What the fields are
-------------------
The values decode the field. The mod writes ``1084227584`` and
``1077936128``, which are ``0x40A00000`` and ``0x40400000`` -- the raw
bit patterns of f32 ``5.0`` and ``3.0``. DMM calls them "raw" because it
carries the float's bits as an integer.

The schema names them. ``InteractionPivotOverrideData`` ends::

    _interactionUpperHeight   f32    4
    _targetGotoOffset         12B    (a 3-float vector)
    _interactionDistance      f32    4     <- raw_a, in declaration order
    _interactionLowerHeight   f32    4     <- raw_b, in declaration order

So when the upper height is 0.0 and the goto offset is (0, 0, 0) -- the
common case -- the pair is preceded by exactly **16 zero bytes**. That is
a typed prediction from the schema, not a pattern noticed in a hex dump,
and it is what this writer looks for.

The 16-zero frame and the two f32 slots after it are **measured**. Which
of the two slots is ``_interactionDistance`` and which is
``_interactionLowerHeight`` is only **inferred from declaration order**,
and declaration order is not always wire order in this format (BuffInfo
pairwise-swaps). Nothing here depends on getting that right: ``raw_a``
is written at +0 and ``raw_b`` at +4 regardless, which is the same
mapping DMM uses, so a mod round-trips either way. Only the ``<-``
annotations above would be wrong.

Locating it
-----------
Scan the record for a position where the preceding 16 bytes are zero and
the next two f32 are in ``[0.01, 100.0]`` -- a sane interaction range.
**Require exactly one such position.** On the live 1.15 table:

* all five records the mod targets resolve to exactly one match, and it
  is the right one (``Gimmick_PickUp`` 2.5/2.5, ``SmallAnimal_Skin``
  1.5/2.0, ``Animal_Skin`` 1.7/2.0, ``Gimmick_Collect`` 2.5/3.0,
  ``Insect_Catch`` 2.5/2.6);
* 295 of 393 records resolve uniquely, 8 have no match and 90 have more
  than one. (291/94 in an earlier revision of this docstring predated the
  4-byte-aligned candidate grid below and was never re-measured --
  ``test_ambiguous_records_are_refused_not_guessed`` pins the real
  numbers now.)

Independent evidence the pair is a real range field rather than
arbitrary bytes that happen to pass the filter: all 295 located values
are multiples of 0.05, against only 54 of the 89 other aligned float
pairs in the same records that pass the same ``[0.01, 100.0]`` filter.
The rule says nothing about quantisation, so this is a property of the
data, not of the locator.

Records in that last group are **refused**, not guessed at. The
16-zero frame only holds when upper height and goto offset are zero; on
a record where they aren't, the scan would find some other pair of
floats, and writing there would corrupt an unrelated field. Ambiguity is
a refusal.

Three earlier locators were tried and thrown away, recorded here so they
aren't retried: a fixed offset from the record's inner id-string (73 on
four records, 89 on ``Gimmick_Collect``); a fixed offset from the name
(varies); and the maximal zero-run end, which is contaminated because
``2.5`` is ``00 00 20 40`` and the run swallows the value's own leading
zero bytes.

Writes are 4 bytes at the same width, so the companion ``.pabgh`` needs
no rebuild.
