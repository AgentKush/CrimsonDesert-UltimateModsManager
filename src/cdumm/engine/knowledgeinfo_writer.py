"""knowledgeinfo.pabgb ``is_default`` writer (recipe/elemental unlocks).

The "Unlock All Equipment and AbyssGear Recipes" (Nexus 2726) and
"Unlock All Elementals" (Nexus 2664) mods do exactly one thing: set
``is_default`` to 1 on a list of knowledge records, so the recipe is
known from the start. Together that is 166 intents, and every one of
them applied zero bytes.

The blocker was not a missing decoder but the schema's wire type.
``KnowledgeInfo._isDefault`` is declared ``direct_15B`` -- a Pearl
Abyss tagged primitive -- and ``validate_intents`` refuses those,
because the schema says how many bytes the field occupies but not
where inside them the value sits. On disk the value is a single byte,
and this writer locates it.

Record layout, verified on all 6219 records of the live 1.15 table::

    +0            u32   key            (equals the PABGH index key)
    +4            u32   name length
    +8            .     name bytes     (``Knowledge_...``)
    name_end+0    u8    always 0
    name_end+1    u32   varies per record (a reader/hash reference)
    name_end+5    u8    is_default     <- the byte this writer sets
    name_end+6    u8    always 13

(Only the *byte* at +6 is invariant; the u32 starting there is not --
the three bytes after it vary. Checking the wider read would refuse
records it shouldn't.)

Why ``name_end+5`` is ``is_default`` and not one of the record's other
booleans:

* Sweeping every offset in ``name_end+0 .. +79``, exactly two are
  boolean-valued (in ``{0, 1}``) across all 6219 records *and* zero on
  all 166 keys the three mods target -- ``+5`` and ``+17``. Every other
  offset is either constant or takes many values.
* ``+17`` is 1 on 51 records and all 51 are ``Knowledge_Skill_Farming/
  Ranching/Logging/Mining_I..III`` -- a life-skill flag, not a
  start-known flag.
* ``+5`` is 1 on 562 records, and they are the ones a character must
  have from the start: ``Knowledge_Hp``, ``Knowledge_CriticalRate``,
  ``Knowledge_AttackSpeedRate``, ``Knowledge_MoveSpeedRate``,
  ``Knowledge_Fatal``, ``Knowledge_KnockOut``, plus the UI gimmick
  icons and node knowledges.
* The alternative assignment contradicts itself: the only other
  direct_15B boolean this could be is ``_isBlocked``, and 562 blocked
  records including every base stat knowledge would mean a character
  with no stats at all.

Not verified in-game by CDUMM. The mod authors verified these files
against DMM 1.4.8 on game 1.14.00, which is what makes "vanilla is 0 on
all 166 targets" meaningful evidence rather than a coincidence.

Writes are length-preserving (one byte, same width), so the companion
``.pabgh`` needs no rebuild.
