"""Verification harness for candidate field-ORDER sources.

The unlock for the other ~82 game tables is a source of correct on-disk
field order (a licensed reader-order parser, or an ASI reflection dump —
see docs/GAME_DATA_UNLOCK_ROADMAP.md). The open question for any such
source is: *why trust it?* The community stat mapping was wrong on 18 of
24 entries, all flagged "verified". Hand-work is not evidence.

This module makes a candidate source **prove itself** against the tables
CDUMM already knows the byte-exact order for, before it is trusted on the
tables it doesn't.

A candidate order source is a mapping::

    { "ItemInfo": ["_isBlocked", "_maxStackCount", ...], ... }

(table name -> field names in on-disk order). It is checked two ways:

1. **Order identity.** For every table CDUMM has a verified
   ``_ordered_fields`` for, the candidate's order must match it exactly.
   Fast, and it catches gross errors (a scramble, a missing field, a
   field in the wrong slot).

2. **Fixture decode score.** Where a committed vanilla fixture exists, the
   candidate order is used to actually *walk the real bytes*. A correct
   order consumes far into each record; a grossly wrong one desyncs almost
   immediately. This does two things order-identity can't: it **anchors
   our own ground truth to real data** (so "verified" means "decodes 6508
   real records", not "someone said so"), and it flags gross corruption.

   It is corroboration, NOT the primary gate, and it has a known blind
   spot: two fields of the same width, swapped upstream of the point where
   the walker stalls, decode identically — the byte count doesn't move.
   Order-identity is what catches those. The decode score's sharpness also
   scales with how far the walker reaches (it stalls early on some tables
   until their nested types are modelled), so it is reported, weighed, but
   never trusted alone.

Order-identity is the workhorse; the decode score keeps it honest. A
source that fails EITHER on any known table is rejected. A source that
passes all of them has earned the benefit of the doubt on the unknown
ones — and even then each new table stays gated to ``verified_fields``
until its values are cross-checked against real records.

# ── superset candidates ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `verify_order_source` compares with `cand == truth`, which is the right
# test for a candidate that claims to be a table's COMPLETE order. Some
# sources are not that shape. A reflection-derived order names every field
# the binary has a read-error string for, which can be more fields than the
# shipped schema models (CharacterInfo: 190 named vs 164 in the schema) and
# fewer than it in the other direction (9 CharacterInfo fields have no error
# string at all). It also uses the binary's real names where the schema
# still carries hand-written placeholders (`_characterName` vs `_stringKey2`).
#
# Exact equality rejects such a source for being differently-shaped rather
# than for being wrong, which tells you nothing. The test that does carry
# information is whether the two agree on the fields they BOTH name, in
# order. That still catches the failure that matters -- a field in the wrong
# slot -- while not penalising a source for knowing more or less.
#
# This is deliberately weaker than `verify_order_source` and does not
# replace it. A superset source earns the right to CORROBORATE a verified
# order, or to supply order for tables that have none; it does not earn
# `_ordered_fields` on its own, because the fields it omits still have to
# be placed by something.
