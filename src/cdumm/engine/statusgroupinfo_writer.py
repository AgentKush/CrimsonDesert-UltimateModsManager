"""statusgroupinfo.pabgb ``status_info_list`` writer.

Nexus mod 2634 "Critical Rate Enhancement" (norva2) ships a Global Critical
Rate patch that retargets one slot of the item-activation stat groups::

    {key: 1000006, field: "status_info_list[3]", op: "set", new: 1000006}

The value is a ``statusinfo`` record key -- these lists hold references to
other records, not numbers.

Record layout
-------------
Derived from the live table and checked by exact tiling: the grammar below
consumes every one of the 8 records to the byte, with nothing left over and
nothing short::

    <u32 key><u32 name_len><name>          the record envelope
    <u8   is_blocked>
    <u32 count><count * u32 statusinfo key>   list 0
    <u32 count><count * u32 statusinfo key>   list 1
    <u32 count><count * u32 statusinfo key>   list 2
    <u32 W><W * u32>                          slot table for list 1
    <u32 W><W * u32>                          slot table for list 0

The two W-entry tables are reverse indexes, and ``W`` is exactly the number
of ``statusinfo`` records -- so it is a property of the GAME BUILD, not a
constant: 75 pre-1.16, **78** on CD 1.16, which added three statusinfo
records. It used to be hardcoded at 75, which made every record fail to
parse on 1.16 and refused every intent with a layout error that read as
"CDUMM cannot read this table" when the table was fine (GitHub #355). It is
now derived per record -- the two tables must agree with each other, and
the record must tile exactly, which a wrong width cannot do.

Each table holds one set entry (everything else is 0xFFFFFFFF) per element
of the list it serves, and the entry value is that element's position in the
list. That correspondence holds on all 8 records for both tables, which is
what pairs table 0 with list 1 and table 1 with list 0. The slot ids are
stable across records: slot 9 resolves to CriticalRate in every record that
sets it, slot 10 to DHIT, and so on.

Which list is ``status_info_list``
----------------------------------
The shipped schema (``schemas/pabgb_complete_schema.json``, StatusGroupInfo)
names three list-typed fields -- ``_statusInfoList``,
``_regenerateStatusInfoList`` and ``_elementalStatusInfoList`` -- and the
wire has exactly three lists. Declaration order does not settle which is
which: it is demonstrably not wire order for this table (it puts
``_regenStatusIndexList`` before ``_key``, and swaps ``_isBlocked`` with
``_stringKey``).

The contents do settle it, the same way on both record families:

* List 2 is ``[Temperature, Confusion, Electricity]`` on every record that
  has one -- the three elemental statuses, so it is
  ``_elementalStatusInfoList``.
* List 0 holds Hp, Fatal, Hunger, Stamina, Mp, Morale, Fury -- regenerating
  resources. List 1 holds DDD, DPV, DHIT, CriticalRate, AttackSpeedRate,
  resistances -- derived combat stats.
* On ``StatOnActivateByItem``, whose entire purpose is the stats an item
  grants, list 0 and list 2 are EMPTY and list 1 carries the stats. A group
  named for granting stats cannot have an empty ``_statusInfoList``.

So list 1 is ``status_info_list``. That is an inference from content rather
than a byte-level proof.

How far the ambiguity guard actually reaches
--------------------------------------------
The writer refuses whenever another list in the same record is also long
enough to satisfy the index. **That is a narrower guarantee than "the
answer is forced regardless of the naming"**, which is what an earlier
revision of this docstring claimed (#320 review). The guard only fires
where two lists overlap; above ``len(list0)`` only list 1 fits, so the
index resolves without the guard ever being consulted and the naming
inference is load-bearing and unchecked -- roughly a hundred index
positions across the table.

It happens to be forced for the two records mod 2634 targets, because
their list 0 and list 2 are empty, so no other list could take the
index at all. For those two the answer really is naming-independent.
Elsewhere it is the content argument above doing the work. Two further
confirmations, both from the review rather than this PR's own evidence:
every decoded value resolves to a real stat name, and record 1000007
``StatOnActivateByItemWithoutAttackSpeedRate`` holds exactly record
1000006's list 1 minus ``AttackSpeedRate`` -- the record's own name
describes list 1's contents.

The reverse index travels with the write
----------------------------------------

Table 0 is a reverse index over list 1. Slot ``s`` holds the POSITION in
this record's list 1 at which slot ``s``'s key sits, or ``0xFFFFFFFF``
when the record does not carry it. On the committed 1.15 fixture the
slot -> key correspondence is one global bijection: all 8 records agree
on all 53 occupied slots, with no slot naming two keys and no key
claiming two slots.

Writing list 1 and leaving table 0 alone therefore produces a state
vanilla never ships -- a slot still claiming a key while pointing at a
position that now holds a different one (#320 review). Whether the game
reads the list, the index, or rebuilds it at load is not known, so the
writer does not gamble on which: it updates table 0 alongside list 1, and
refuses whenever it cannot.

``learn_slot_keys`` recovers the correspondence from the table itself
rather than assuming a rule, because there is no rule -- slot 3 is key
1000074 while slot 4 is key 1000002.

Two edits have no correct index and are refused outright:

* one that would list a key twice. A reverse index maps a key to one
  position, so a repeated key is unrepresentable. This is what mod 2634
  asks for -- CriticalDamage at positions 2 and 3, CriticalRate gone --
  and it is why that mod no longer applies. Refusing is the answer the
  format gives; writing the list and leaving a contradictory index is
  not a better one.
* one naming a key the index has no slot for, since the slot that must
  point at it is then unknown.

    """(min, max) statusinfo key the range check will accept.

    Widened from every source of evidence, never narrowed. The check
    exists to catch a value that is obviously not a record reference --
    a 5, a 2**31 -- not to be an exact membership test, so a bound that
    is too TIGHT is the harmful direction: it refuses mods that are
    correct.

    That is exactly what went wrong. The shipped snapshot is CD 1.13's 75
    keys (1000000..1000074), and on CD 1.16 the statusinfo table has 78
    records spanning 1000000..**1000078** -- and the vanilla
    statusgroupinfo lists reference keys right up to that top. The frozen
    bound would refuse a reference the game itself makes.

    ``observed`` is the set of keys the vanilla lists actually hold, which
    the caller has already parsed. It is direct, on-disk evidence from the
    build in front of us and costs nothing to collect, so it is folded in.

    Note the key space is NOT contiguous -- 78 records span 79 slots, so
    one key in the range is absent. That is why the bound cannot be
    derived from the reverse-index width (``lo + width - 1`` would be one
    short); the span has to come from real keys.

    Only the CEILING moves. ``_MIN_STATUS_KEY`` is a structural fact of
    the key space, so a source containing something below it is telling
    us it is not a statusinfo key set -- widening the floor to match
    would let a bare ``5`` through, which is the garbage this check
    exists to stop. Keys below the floor are therefore ignored, not
