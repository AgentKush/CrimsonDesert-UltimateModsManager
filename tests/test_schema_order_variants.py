"""The walker's field order is chosen by VALUES, on the path users see.

There are two independent iteminfo readers: the hand-written
``iteminfo_native_parser``, and the generic walker driven by
``_ordered_fields``. CD 1.16 removed two ItemInfo fields, and a removed
field is the worst drift there is -- the walker keeps reading, takes the
NEXT field's bytes as the missing one, and desyncs everything after it.

Two earlier mistakes are pinned here so they cannot come back.

**It was unreachable.** ``ORDER_VARIANTS`` is keyed ``"ItemInfo"``, but
production reaches selection through ``identify_table_from_path``, which
yields the file stem ``"iteminfo"``. The lookup was a bare ``in`` test
with no case normalisation, so it never matched in production -- while
every test called it with the CamelCase spelling and passed. Green tests
over code that cannot run. So the tests below use the *production*
spelling, and one asserts both spellings agree.

**Walk depth was the wrong arbiter.** ``decode_score`` counts how far a
walk gets, and the failure that matters is a walk that goes exactly as
far while reading the wrong bytes. On live 1.16 the winning order scores
a median 109 of 109 fields at 87.5% full depth while ``_maxEndurance``
and ``_respawnTimeSeconds`` agree with the native parser on **zero** of
5,756 records -- both land 10 bytes off, inside the opaque run, and
consume the same number of bytes doing it. The arbiter is now the native
parser's decoded values, which is a real oracle: #336 established it
byte-exact, and it is what settled where the 1.16 10-byte run goes.
