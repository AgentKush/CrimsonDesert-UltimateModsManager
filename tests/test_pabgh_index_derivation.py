"""The pabgh count width is derived, not looked up by name.

A pabgh index is ``[count][count x (key, u32 offset)]``, and the count
prefix is 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the table. Which one it was came
from ``UINT_COUNT_TABLES``, a hand-maintained set of table names — so it
was simply wrong for any table nobody had added, and a table whose index
does not parse is invisible to every writer, silently.

``aimemoryinfo`` is exactly that: it needs a u32 count, is not on the
list, and could not be read at all.

The width is now derived from the header. Measured over a full current
install: 133 tables parse identically to before, 2 that could not be
read now can, and none disagree.
